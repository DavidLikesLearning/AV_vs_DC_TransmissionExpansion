# AV_vs_DC_TransmissionExpansion
We're exploring how the additional asynchronous power injection of a HVDC line and it's higher siting chance in the 2024 transmission expansion regulatory environment affects the decision to build AC or DC lines for a given connection.

DC_OPF Transmission Expansion models, siting delay distributions and historical data informed Net Present Value underlie our method.
